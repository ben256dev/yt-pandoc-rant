00:00.000 --> 00:07.120
Any time I want to write something, lab reports, articles, math, tables, images, slideshows,

00:07.120 --> 00:11.280
I use the same method, VIM, Markdown, and Pandog.

00:11.280 --> 00:18.960
A year ago, literally today, I had no VIM, no Linux, or Git command line experience.

00:18.960 --> 00:25.320
And today, I use Unix exclusively for all programming and document preparation.

00:25.320 --> 00:30.880
Last year, I completely wiped Windows, and I switched 100% to Unix.

00:30.880 --> 00:35.840
I use VIM specifically, uh, NeoVIM, just out of habit.

00:35.840 --> 00:40.840
People told me to use NeoVIM, because it's got support for plugins and stuff.

00:40.840 --> 00:44.160
I never installed plugins, but I still, I use VIM.

00:44.160 --> 00:45.360
Just raw VIM.

00:45.360 --> 00:47.400
My terminal is default.

00:47.400 --> 00:53.120
There's no fancy colors, no skull, color scheme, nothing.

00:53.120 --> 00:59.680
I even switched my keyboard layout to call MacDH with home raw mods, because I was so

00:59.680 --> 01:04.520
serious about trying, uh, this attempt, right?

01:04.520 --> 01:10.960
So a year ago, I was using Visual Studio, Microsoft Visual Studio, and trust me, I really

01:10.960 --> 01:13.880
liked the hot keys in Microsoft Visual Studio.

01:13.880 --> 01:17.760
I would do this alt arrow thing to move the line up and down.

01:17.760 --> 01:21.360
You hold the control shift, and you can do multi-line editing, and stuff.

01:21.360 --> 01:26.640
It was really nice, and I really liked the hot keys, uh, like even the most autistic

01:26.640 --> 01:32.080
people in my major, I swear, in my computer science major, I knew the hot keys better

01:32.080 --> 01:33.880
than them.

01:33.880 --> 01:39.560
So it was a bum to move to VIM, and not be able to use those hot keys anymore.

01:39.560 --> 01:47.880
But after I made the switch, I realized that I didn't need those hot keys.

01:47.880 --> 01:55.080
The reason, let's back up, the reason why I made the switch is I was playing Civ5.

01:55.080 --> 02:02.240
I didn't play a single video game for like a year, and I was starting to realize when

02:02.240 --> 02:10.240
I was playing Civ5, that, uh, if I had the opportunity to, if I'm able to, I'm always

02:10.240 --> 02:12.040
going to use hot keys.

02:12.040 --> 02:15.320
There's never a moment where I'm like, oh, I'm not going to use hot keys, I'd rather

02:15.320 --> 02:16.320
just use the mouse.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.320
I know it, right?

02:18.320 --> 02:20.960
So I kept, you know, you play Civ5 for long enough.

02:20.960 --> 02:23.520
I have like a thousand hours in that game.

02:23.520 --> 02:27.400
I was never a hot key, or keyboard wizard or nothing.

02:27.400 --> 02:37.400
I was a FPS player, I liked using my mouse, I like clicking on stuff, but you do something

02:37.400 --> 02:38.400
for long enough.

02:38.400 --> 02:42.680
You start to gravitate towards the keyboard, it's just so natural and so nice to use the

02:42.680 --> 02:43.680
keyboard.

02:43.680 --> 02:49.360
Instead, you know, Civ5, Civ5 has an amazing UR, it's so nice to click on buttons.

02:49.360 --> 02:55.840
Those buttons are so juicy in Civilization 5, and regardless, you know, every time I'm

02:55.840 --> 02:57.880
building a farm, I'm like, this is so repetitive.

02:57.880 --> 03:03.320
I have to click the farm button every time, and I start to realize every, about every

03:03.320 --> 03:08.680
action in the game you can take with a unit, um, has a hot key, so you just hover over,

03:08.680 --> 03:10.440
oh, you press I to build a farm.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.440
Okay.

03:11.440 --> 03:16.200
And then you slowly learn all the hot keys, like, for example, I could tell you right

03:16.200 --> 03:18.200
now camp.

03:18.200 --> 03:23.560
There's some fur, some little foxes running around in the hex, or there's a, uh, some

03:23.560 --> 03:31.160
ivory, some elephants, H, H is to build a farm, uh, P for plantation, I think, uh, are

03:31.160 --> 03:36.480
for road, you know, I remember, I think I remember a lot of these, I, for farm, I believe,

03:37.480 --> 03:42.480
um, and I started to realize, like, you can't do everything with the mouse, but the

03:42.480 --> 03:45.000
more you can do it, the keyboard, the better.

03:45.000 --> 03:52.160
So I decided to adopt a more terminal centric full, I guess, another person who inspired

03:52.160 --> 03:59.960
me to do this was, uh, I think his name is Soding Daily, TS Oding Daily, this Russian guy,

03:59.960 --> 04:03.760
and I was watching him use, like, e-max and a bunch of other stuff, and I think that

04:03.760 --> 04:11.920
was inspiring, like, oh, I could do this, another guy, um, there's 10, 10, 10, as this

04:11.920 --> 04:17.920
guy's got long hair, he's from Scandinavia, or something I believe, and, um, he made

04:17.920 --> 04:22.720
these videos where he did exclusively keyboard centric stuff.

04:22.720 --> 04:30.880
In 10, 10's videos, he managed to do everything with the keyboard on his computer, and he

04:30.880 --> 04:34.920
talked about Vimalot, and this is where I got introduced to the idea of using Vim, Vim is

04:34.920 --> 04:36.680
a modal editor, right?

04:36.680 --> 04:41.600
So Vim has certain modes where, like, if you mess up suddenly enter a different mode,

04:41.600 --> 04:46.120
and you're not, like, in the text editor, like, you expect to be normally, you can't just

04:46.120 --> 04:48.360
move around with the arrow keys.

04:48.360 --> 04:52.480
In fact, in Vim, you're actively encouraged to not use the arrow keys, you're supposed to

04:52.480 --> 04:54.960
use HJKL, right?

04:54.960 --> 04:58.960
And then it turns out you're not supposed to use that either, necessarily, you're supposed

04:58.960 --> 05:06.520
to learn word-based motions, sentence-based motions, paragraph-based motions, you're supposed

05:06.520 --> 05:11.600
to get as efficient as possible, and take as many shortcuts as possible.

05:11.600 --> 05:17.400
Now a lot of people switch to Unix because they don't want spyware, they don't want the

05:17.400 --> 05:23.000
government to spy on or something or their edgy, or they want to write out their setup

05:23.000 --> 05:25.720
and make it look cooler, I don't mess with any of that.

05:25.720 --> 05:29.280
Like I said, I just use the default terminal, I do not care.

05:29.280 --> 05:34.120
The reason why I use Unix is because I want package managers.

05:34.120 --> 05:38.920
In Windows, I don't know, so many times, you're trying to install something in Windows,

05:38.920 --> 05:44.400
and it's like, how do I, okay, do I get the installer for it, do I get the, do I do it with

05:44.400 --> 05:49.200
the command line or script or what, and then it's just, it's so complicated.

05:49.200 --> 05:54.600
Generally, in Unix, when I need something installed, it's just pseudo-apt installed, and

05:54.600 --> 05:59.960
then the name of what I want, like Firefox, right, pseudo-apt install Firefox, pseudo-apt

05:59.960 --> 06:00.960
install VLC.

06:00.960 --> 06:01.960
Now I got VLC.

06:01.960 --> 06:04.000
Now I got Firefox.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.840
The other thing is like, you do install things on Windows, but sometimes just setting it up,

06:09.840 --> 06:10.840
it just doesn't work.

06:10.840 --> 06:14.240
Like I tried to, I remember trying to install Python on Windows, and it was such a pain,

06:14.240 --> 06:18.920
like it was so hard to install Python, you would think that would be easy, right?

06:18.920 --> 06:24.560
Let's address the alternative, and I used to use these two, of course, Google Docs.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.200
Microsoft Word.

06:26.200 --> 06:33.800
These are nice, because they are hosting your files remotely, and they kind of save stuff

06:33.800 --> 06:37.600
very often, and of course, they have a lot of features, right?

06:37.600 --> 06:41.160
You've got your equations and stuff, if you want to insert those, you can style stuff

06:41.160 --> 06:46.560
however you want, but Mark Down is better, I'll tell you why.

06:46.560 --> 06:52.520
So think about Google Docs, how many times have you been like working with your group

06:52.560 --> 07:00.760
mates, or maybe at work or something, and someone is just in there collaborating, and

07:00.760 --> 07:06.960
they put like a stupid random indent, or they put an inconsistent heading, or they put

07:06.960 --> 07:12.280
like an extra space, or they style like the font, like slightly different sizes, it's

07:12.280 --> 07:13.840
so silly, right?

07:13.840 --> 07:20.760
You're never going to need the feature to have one paragraph be a different size than

07:20.760 --> 07:22.040
the other, right?

07:22.040 --> 07:25.200
You're always going to be wanting to have your paragraph the same size.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.440
You always want consistent headings.

07:27.440 --> 07:35.920
I once had a teacher, and she was teaching a communications class, and she really emphasized

07:35.920 --> 07:40.880
she wanted consistent formatting, and so we couldn't even use Google Docs.

07:40.880 --> 07:45.520
We had to use Microsoft Word, because Microsoft Word was better about making the styling

07:45.520 --> 07:48.120
consistent across headings.

07:48.120 --> 07:54.120
So at the time, I remember thinking there's got to be a better solution to this, right?

07:54.120 --> 08:00.080
Then going through all your headings and selecting them and setting the styling for them

08:00.080 --> 08:04.600
and eventually making sure the consistent rise, it's silly, right?

08:04.600 --> 08:11.000
The funny thing about Google Docs is Google Docs, eventually now Google Docs, lets you

08:11.000 --> 08:13.320
write Mark Down in Google Docs.

08:13.360 --> 08:18.000
If you put a hash into Google Docs, it'll be like, oh, you want a heading one, or if

08:18.000 --> 08:23.800
you put, I think you can bold stuff with like, asterix and stuff, and it just goes to

08:23.800 --> 08:28.920
show how helpful Mark Down is that even Google Docs uses it.

08:28.920 --> 08:35.400
But here's the thing, I'll argue in this video that you should not be worrying about

08:35.400 --> 08:39.200
your styling, you should be worrying about your writing, right?

08:39.200 --> 08:41.520
That's what Mark Down enables you to do.

08:41.520 --> 08:45.840
This syntax is simpler than anything you've ever used.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.840
Mark Down syntax is so simple.

08:47.840 --> 08:52.760
I write a whole Mark Down file, like my whole article or write up or whatever it is, and

08:52.760 --> 08:57.120
then I basically compile it once or twice, and there's no mistakes, like you're not going

08:57.120 --> 09:03.000
to say, oh, I made that huge mistake and then edited a bunch, it's minimal, it's minimal,

09:03.000 --> 09:09.080
you just write something and it's so effortless, versus Google Docs, you have to stare

09:09.080 --> 09:13.080
at the end styling of your product, and you have to worry about the styling, every time

09:13.080 --> 09:20.760
you make something, well, the styling isn't going to change that much per assignment, or

09:20.760 --> 09:23.000
per article, or thing you write.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.200
Use your word about the styling later, write a template, Pandox supports templates, you

09:27.200 --> 09:32.200
can have an HTML template file, and you can use that for any Mark Down file.

09:32.200 --> 09:33.920
Pandox is so simple, right?

09:33.920 --> 09:40.000
You just specify the output file format, or I mean, really, you just specify the output

09:40.000 --> 09:46.360
file and it looks at the file extension and figures out what you need to convert it to.

09:46.360 --> 09:54.360
You can also export to HTML or PDF, and when you export to HTML, you can embed images

09:54.360 --> 10:01.360
in the HTML, so you get all the advantages of PDF minus the disadvantages of PDF.

10:01.360 --> 10:06.800
PDF is slow, PDF sucks with, you have a page break all the time, right?

10:06.800 --> 10:11.960
How many times have you been reading something, and then you have a figure, right?

10:11.960 --> 10:15.160
And then it gets like put on a different page, and then you're supposed to like look

10:15.160 --> 10:19.600
one or two pages ahead to view the figure, it's so stupid.

10:19.600 --> 10:25.120
In the modern age, when everything is being viewed in the browser, we should just be using

10:25.120 --> 10:28.160
HTML, this doesn't make sense to use PDF.

10:28.160 --> 10:35.480
With HTML, if you want to embed an image, it's as simple as you add dash-embed dash resources

10:35.480 --> 10:36.480
for Pandox.

10:36.480 --> 10:40.040
Next, it's funny how people reinvent the wheel.

10:40.040 --> 10:45.720
Like I see people talking all the time about, or not people, but like I've seen instances

10:45.720 --> 10:51.920
where there's like these apps that are for writing, and the thing they're trying to sell

10:51.920 --> 10:57.040
you is that, well, when you revise your writing, there's a lot of stuff you threw

10:57.040 --> 10:58.040
away.

10:58.040 --> 11:02.640
We'll save every version of everything you throw away so that you can compile it later

11:02.640 --> 11:06.480
and make something out of your deleted writing.

11:06.480 --> 11:12.760
And it's just so funny to hear people who don't know, well, we'll just call them normies

11:12.760 --> 11:18.920
who don't know about Git, basically talking about like how they want Git, and you know,

11:18.920 --> 11:21.240
a year ago, I wasn't that good at Git.

11:21.240 --> 11:24.680
I was relying on GitHub desktop if I want to do something.

11:24.760 --> 11:29.440
I had a class where we learned about version control, and I said, this is stupid.

11:29.440 --> 11:32.520
Why do we have to do this with the command line when there's a GUI for it?

11:32.520 --> 11:35.240
This is so like we're doing it the ancient way or whatever.

11:35.240 --> 11:39.520
I had a class where we learned about Unix, and I had to do VIM tutor.

11:39.520 --> 11:42.120
I had to learn VIM, and I was like, this is weird.

11:42.120 --> 11:44.440
Why would I ever edit and VIM or whatever?

11:44.440 --> 11:46.640
What is the point of this?

11:46.640 --> 11:51.960
And I've slowly got humbled over time, and I have arguments with people who are stuck

11:52.040 --> 11:54.680
in the first phase, the phase that I was in.

11:54.680 --> 12:00.400
And they're like, oh, I like to get GUI because I could see it easier.

12:00.400 --> 12:01.800
It's not as hard.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.520
GitHub GUI is a nice application.

12:04.520 --> 12:10.920
However, Git is like the perfect command line tool.

12:10.920 --> 12:17.880
It's like, you know, it's like an example of what command line tools can be, how helpful,

12:17.880 --> 12:21.120
and how useful, and how good they can look.

12:21.200 --> 12:24.240
It's such a nice tool to use over the command line.

12:24.240 --> 12:28.480
And if you're a computer science major or a programmer or a software engineer,

12:28.480 --> 12:32.000
you have no excuse for not learning Git, read the command line.

12:32.000 --> 12:38.160
Anytime you want to do anything complicated, you can't be searching for a little drop-down

12:38.160 --> 12:46.000
menu or some item in a GUI and GitHub desktop when you need to check out a branch or

12:46.080 --> 12:51.040
stash some stuff, or, I don't know, just amend a commit or something like you need to just,

12:51.040 --> 12:52.720
it's not that hard.

12:52.720 --> 12:58.160
I understand that it seems daunting, and it can be really boring to learn these tools

12:58.160 --> 13:00.320
and really scary at first.

13:00.320 --> 13:03.760
But trust, listen, I went a year, a year.

13:03.760 --> 13:08.960
It took me a year to get to the point where I do so much stuff over the terminal.

13:08.960 --> 13:13.840
And note that something else, I got a virtual private server.

13:13.840 --> 13:19.680
A virtual private server, mines in Seattle, it's a computer that is remote on the cloud

13:19.680 --> 13:21.760
that I can access anytime I want.

13:21.760 --> 13:28.640
That's the advantage of using a terminal is that if it's running on Unix,

13:28.640 --> 13:32.800
you can use SSH to access that terminal anywhere in the world.

13:32.800 --> 13:39.440
I can get into that computer from an unrelated computer as long as I have the right password

13:39.440 --> 13:40.720
and permissions and stuff.

13:40.720 --> 13:45.440
It's kind of similar to how in Google Docs, you're like, oh, I'm so glad that I can go to the

13:45.440 --> 13:49.600
browser and use this anywhere and I'll have access to my code.

13:49.600 --> 13:52.240
Well, you have the same thing with Git.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.960
You have the same thing if you have a VPS, right?

13:54.960 --> 13:57.520
Because you can host your files wherever you want.

13:57.520 --> 14:02.000
And in my experience, it's easier to host files on my VPS and share them.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.920
So what I do on my VPS, I have a website.

14:05.920 --> 14:13.440
It's at Ben256.com and what I like to do is I hash my files.

14:13.440 --> 14:17.200
When you hash it generates a signature, it uniquely identifies the file.

14:18.160 --> 14:21.520
That makes sure that I never have duplicates on my server.

14:21.520 --> 14:27.520
Then I put that in the URL along with the file and I can send that to anyone.

14:27.520 --> 14:30.960
And then they can just open it up like you go to Ben256.com.

14:31.920 --> 14:38.960
The notes for this video are Ben256.com slash MarkdownRant.html.

14:38.960 --> 14:45.600
There's also a MarkdownRant.md and that's just one example of how easy it is to share things.

14:45.600 --> 14:51.680
And when I'm in the terminal, like we said earlier, it's so nice to be able to use a package manager.

14:51.680 --> 14:55.040
I found out there's a program called QR and code.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.840
You can sue to apps and install QR and code.

14:57.840 --> 15:02.640
And then when you have your URL that you host on your website,

15:02.640 --> 15:07.280
you just pipe it into QR and code and you can generate a QR code on your laptop.

15:07.280 --> 15:10.160
And then you tell your lab partner, whoever you want to share it with,

15:10.160 --> 15:13.280
hey, scan this on your phone and now they have it on their phone.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.960
No emailing required.

15:14.960 --> 15:19.280
If you don't want to be so specific and have a giant hash in the URL,

15:19.280 --> 15:26.080
then you can just straight up put it on like Ben256.com MarkdownRant.html.

15:26.080 --> 15:32.080
I didn't hash that or anything. I just stuck it on the website to make it convenient to use.

15:32.080 --> 15:37.600
Now, personally, what I do is if I'm going to submit an assignment,

15:37.600 --> 15:42.880
and again, to reiterate, I submitted every single assignment using Markdown.

15:42.880 --> 15:48.400
I haven't submitted any assignments using Google Docs or nothing or anything else.

15:48.480 --> 15:52.640
Whenever they ask for PDF, PDF is a stupid format.

15:52.640 --> 15:57.840
And sometimes, especially if you have a lot of images, it can look really bad in a PDF.

15:58.400 --> 16:01.200
Even if Pam Doc converts it, it does it's best, right?

16:02.320 --> 16:06.240
But if you have a ton of images, they're not going to all fit on one page.

16:06.240 --> 16:10.320
And PDF has the stupid thing where there's page breaks all the time,

16:10.320 --> 16:13.920
as if you're going to print it or something, nobody prints anything anymore.

16:13.920 --> 16:18.320
So it's okay, what you do, the PDF version can be inferior.

16:18.880 --> 16:25.520
And you can upload that to your course website or whoever needs the PDF.

16:25.520 --> 16:32.320
But then, you just put a link in the PDF and link to your HTML version, which is superior,

16:32.320 --> 16:36.000
or I go in the comments of my submission. I say, hey, check out the HTML version.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.320
It's better, even though you ask for a PDF, I gave you one, but the HTML is better.

16:40.320 --> 16:45.840
You might as well read that. And then, I never get any concerns for my greater.

16:45.840 --> 16:48.480
Like, I can't read this because the figures are hard to read.

16:48.480 --> 16:50.720
No, there's an HTML version.

16:50.720 --> 16:52.960
And the HTML version looks so good.

16:52.960 --> 16:58.160
Pandox, default conversion and the styling for HTML looks just good enough.

16:58.160 --> 17:00.000
Like, there's nothing wrong with it.

17:00.000 --> 17:05.760
You can even do slides in HTML using Pandox.

17:06.720 --> 17:09.680
And the library is revealed.js.

17:09.680 --> 17:14.480
And these slides, let me tell you, these slides are superior in every way.

17:14.480 --> 17:16.880
It's a PowerPoint format or whatever.

17:16.880 --> 17:22.640
Because when you export PowerPoint, your browser doesn't open that easily, right?

17:22.640 --> 17:28.880
So what you end up doing is, I just had a class where the teacher, he converted his slides

17:28.880 --> 17:31.440
the PowerPoint format into PDF.

17:31.600 --> 17:36.960
So then, you had to constantly download this stupid huge PDF.

17:36.960 --> 17:39.520
And it was just a waste, right?

17:39.520 --> 17:45.680
Versus HTML, HTML is faster than PDF and just so much more convenient, right?

17:45.680 --> 17:47.360
That's what the browser is for.

17:47.360 --> 17:50.800
How many times are you going to download a PDF file?

17:50.800 --> 17:56.000
PDF, PDF, parentheses one, PDF parentheses two, parentheses three,

17:56.000 --> 17:59.600
parentheses four. How many times am I going to download this file?

17:59.600 --> 18:02.640
If I'm just going to delete it, like, I have to remember to delete it.

18:02.640 --> 18:04.160
That's what the browser is for.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.880
That's why you serve files statically on a website.

18:08.400 --> 18:10.240
HTML slides are epic.

18:10.240 --> 18:11.680
And they look cooler.

18:11.680 --> 18:15.440
They look more professional and more epic, or, okay, objectively.

18:16.080 --> 18:20.960
Now, a lot of people do static site generation.

18:21.760 --> 18:28.800
What that is, basically, is people don't want to have to write raw HTML.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.880
Every time they make a new article, of course.

18:31.520 --> 18:36.480
So, what some people do, well, some people, they do just write HTML.

18:36.480 --> 18:37.600
And that's kind of cringe.

18:38.560 --> 18:40.880
There's this really cool guy. I really like this guy.

18:40.880 --> 18:45.680
He's like a bipolar schizophrenic guy and he's bald.

18:46.240 --> 18:49.600
And his name is Luke Smith and he's like afraid of the government.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.120
So he lives in the woods.

18:51.120 --> 18:54.960
But he has a really excellent tutorial on how to set up your website.

18:55.040 --> 18:58.960
And that's what I followed to set up my website with my VPS and stuff.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.600
And he was a big advocate.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.120
He started making this video.

19:03.120 --> 19:06.080
He was like, look, I'm not to start writing raw HTML.

19:06.080 --> 19:09.440
And it's such a pain to write HTML, like, playing.

19:09.440 --> 19:10.960
Especially if you're doing a lot of it.

19:10.960 --> 19:13.360
Every time you need a paragraph, you need to put a P tag.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.560
It's so goofy.

19:14.560 --> 19:16.400
That's what markdown is for.

19:16.400 --> 19:19.280
You don't want to be opening a tag, enclosing your tag,

19:19.280 --> 19:24.720
and making sure you have a right tag, and then writing your HTML boiler

19:24.720 --> 19:27.280
plate. That's what Pandok handles that for you.

19:27.280 --> 19:31.680
That's what the dash s, the dash dash stand alone flag does in Pandok.

19:31.680 --> 19:34.160
It gives you boiler plate for your HTML.

19:34.160 --> 19:38.000
Converse your markdown into HTML, semantic HTML.

19:38.000 --> 19:43.360
Now, I also, I had a friend who he decided he was going to make a static site.

19:43.360 --> 19:44.720
And he was going to generate it.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.400
He's going to do a static site generator.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.800
And I don't know why people do this.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.480
I've seen a lot of programmers doing this.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.560
They think, oh, I'm a programmer.

19:52.640 --> 19:54.480
I'm going to write it in markdown.

19:54.480 --> 19:58.160
And I'm going to convert it to HTML myself.

19:58.160 --> 20:00.880
Guys, we don't need to reinvent the wheel.

20:00.880 --> 20:03.200
Pandok does everything for us.

20:03.200 --> 20:07.840
If you don't like the styling, that's why you use an HTML template.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.160
And all it does is it does substitution.

20:10.160 --> 20:14.480
It substitutes the text and puts it into the HTML template

20:14.480 --> 20:17.200
that you provide with the styling that you want.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.560
I'll give you an example.

20:18.640 --> 20:24.960
If you go to Ben256.com slash read, I published a bunch of public domain

20:24.960 --> 20:28.320
Plato texts from like Plato, the philosopher.

20:28.320 --> 20:30.000
I was trying to get my friends to replay it.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.760
And it didn't really work.

20:31.760 --> 20:35.520
However, what you could do with this, right?

20:35.520 --> 20:36.960
You can see the site.

20:36.960 --> 20:39.840
I added in a little bar that scrolls.

20:39.840 --> 20:40.960
It shows the completion.

20:40.960 --> 20:43.040
Like how much you've read the article.

20:43.040 --> 20:46.560
I added in a nav that is like statically generated.

20:46.960 --> 20:51.440
There is whenever I update the pages,

20:51.440 --> 20:55.280
there's like an automatic script that runs and updates the last updated.

20:56.320 --> 20:57.040
It's so nice.

20:57.040 --> 21:00.800
There's even footnotes are supported through Markdown.

21:00.800 --> 21:03.360
If you use Pandok, it's so awesome.

21:03.360 --> 21:06.640
And then everything as the right styling, everything looks nice.

21:06.640 --> 21:11.520
You compare that to where I got the source material.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.800
I went to Project Gutenberg and these websites.

21:14.880 --> 21:16.880
Therefore, archival purposes.

21:16.880 --> 21:19.680
They're not for like reading the whole text, right?

21:19.680 --> 21:23.520
They suck for that because they have like these terrible old sites.

21:23.520 --> 21:25.280
They're like horrible to read.

21:25.280 --> 21:29.440
So what you do, or what I did, is I went and I got the UTF8 for it.

21:29.440 --> 21:30.400
I just copied it.

21:30.400 --> 21:36.000
I did a, this tiny little bit of like edits in a VIM to make it

21:36.000 --> 21:38.960
a correctly formatted Markdown file.

21:38.960 --> 21:42.400
Put in a little bit of metadata, title author translator.

21:43.360 --> 21:47.040
And then I just run a script like I do on every other

21:47.040 --> 21:49.040
Plato text that I've uploaded.

21:49.040 --> 21:52.560
So if you go to Ben256.com slash read, you can see that.

21:52.560 --> 21:56.160
And you can see an example of me,

21:56.160 --> 21:58.320
everything I wrote there is Markdown.

21:58.320 --> 22:01.120
Finally, we have to talk about Lawtech.

22:01.120 --> 22:08.480
Lawtech in some ways is important mainly for math equations.

22:08.480 --> 22:11.840
In other ways, it's like a worse version of Markdown.

22:11.840 --> 22:15.360
So I've seen graduate students, they write

22:15.360 --> 22:17.360
entire documents in Lawtech.

22:17.360 --> 22:19.360
And hopefully they're using templates.

22:19.360 --> 22:21.520
If not, they probably want to kill themselves.

22:21.520 --> 22:25.280
Because Lawtech, it has all these slash begins, slash

22:25.280 --> 22:27.760
and use package or like whatever.

22:27.760 --> 22:30.320
There's so much garbage in Lawtech.

22:30.320 --> 22:34.240
Like just to make like an unordered list or something,

22:34.240 --> 22:37.200
it takes so much effort mentally and so much,

22:37.200 --> 22:40.720
you have to remember so much like you might as well just ask AI

22:40.720 --> 22:42.880
to write the Lawtech document for you.

22:42.880 --> 22:44.800
If you're going to write something yourself,

22:44.800 --> 22:46.400
don't write it in Lawtech.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.320
If you want math equations,

22:48.320 --> 22:52.960
well also don't use Google Docs and like go and look through a big menu

22:52.960 --> 22:56.320
with like a big table like, oh, where's my, how do I make a fraction?

22:56.320 --> 22:58.320
Oh, I got to go look for the fraction.

22:58.320 --> 23:00.000
Oh, I got to do the square root.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.720
Instead of doing the goofy parts of Lawtech in Lawtech,

23:04.720 --> 23:07.680
do all the goofy parts of Lawtech in Markdown.

23:07.680 --> 23:12.160
Using Pandok, you can embed Lawtech into your Markdown.

23:12.160 --> 23:14.000
So you get all the upsides of Lawtech.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.200
You can put Lawtech equations into your Markdown.

23:17.200 --> 23:21.600
And then you don't have to do titles or headings with Lawtech.

23:21.600 --> 23:27.600
If you want to be a boomer and write your whole page in just raw HTML,

23:27.600 --> 23:31.680
well, you also don't have an excuse for not using Markdown in Pandok.

23:32.640 --> 23:36.160
You can embed HTML into your Markdown.

23:36.240 --> 23:40.400
If a template isn't working for you, finally,

23:40.400 --> 23:45.920
how many times have you seen a code example in a PDF or something,

23:45.920 --> 23:50.160
especially if you're like a college, like a CS major, right?

23:51.760 --> 23:54.240
The professors, they're always putting these.

23:54.240 --> 23:58.480
They just put these like black and white, like they paste code into Google Docs

23:58.480 --> 23:59.840
and it's black and white.

23:59.840 --> 24:02.560
It's not even, sometimes it's not even mono space.

24:02.560 --> 24:04.560
And there's no syntax highlighting.

24:04.640 --> 24:06.400
This is so goofy.

24:06.400 --> 24:10.320
There's an obvious solution and they just don't bother to find it.

24:10.320 --> 24:10.880
Okay.

24:10.880 --> 24:17.840
The solution is the same thing that your read me uses on GitHub.

24:17.840 --> 24:22.240
When you have a GitHub read me, you write Markdown and you put your code in.

24:22.240 --> 24:25.440
And you do like three backs, backticks.

24:25.440 --> 24:31.920
And then you put the name of the programming language that the code is made out of, right?

24:32.000 --> 24:38.640
And then the GitHub interprets the GitHub interpreter

24:38.640 --> 24:43.680
for the Markdown converts it into HTML or PDF,

24:43.680 --> 24:45.520
or I guess you could get a PDF or whatever.

24:46.720 --> 24:50.800
It does that with correct syntax highlighting for the language.

24:50.800 --> 24:53.360
You can do that with Pandok and Markdown.

24:53.360 --> 24:56.000
You don't need GitHub's version or whatever.

24:56.000 --> 24:56.640
I do this.

24:56.640 --> 24:59.200
I've done this a million times every time I put code in,

24:59.280 --> 25:02.480
I specify the language into the Markdown file.

25:02.480 --> 25:04.400
I embed that code in there.

25:04.400 --> 25:08.000
And then when I export it as HTML, it looks beautiful.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.560
It's correctly syntax highlights it.

25:10.560 --> 25:13.760
It's all mono space, or yeah, it's all mono space.

25:15.040 --> 25:19.760
PDF, PDF sometimes breaks if you have really wide code like a comment.

25:19.760 --> 25:21.440
It's like goes on forever.

25:21.440 --> 25:25.600
But if you export as HTML, you use the standalone flag.

25:25.600 --> 25:28.000
It'll give you a scrollable region.

25:28.080 --> 25:29.520
So it'll get cut off.

25:29.520 --> 25:34.480
But if you want to see the rest of the line, you can scroll horizontally.

25:34.480 --> 25:39.520
So I want to emphasize, like if I wish I had a book to write,

25:39.520 --> 25:43.440
I wish I was like some kind of novelist or author or something,

25:43.440 --> 25:47.200
because it is so enjoyable writing Markdown.

25:47.200 --> 25:52.960
Every time I write Markdown, I'm just, I'm going to climax when I write Markdown, okay?

25:53.920 --> 25:57.600
We got to stop writing inward or docs, okay?

25:57.600 --> 26:00.880
Especially as programmers, it's cringe.

26:00.880 --> 26:02.080
We got to stop doing this.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.760
We shouldn't be rewriting static site generators.

26:07.760 --> 26:10.960
When Pandok does it for us, it's, I installed it once,

26:10.960 --> 26:12.800
and it's amazing and beautiful.

26:12.800 --> 26:15.680
And then next time you're going to make some slides,

26:15.680 --> 26:17.040
consider using Pandok.

26:17.040 --> 26:19.840
Next time you're going to make a website, go ask chat,

26:20.640 --> 26:25.760
Hey, chat, GPT, how do I convert Markdown into HTML with a nice template

26:25.760 --> 26:28.160
so that my HTML styling looks nice?

26:28.160 --> 26:30.080
And just have it generated in an example template,

26:30.080 --> 26:32.640
and then mess with it until you like the styling.

26:32.640 --> 26:37.040
Always use Markdown for, for any writing you do,

26:37.040 --> 26:38.640
because it's distraction free.

26:38.640 --> 26:39.920
You don't have to worry about the styling.

26:39.920 --> 26:42.880
You just spit out some Markdown.

26:42.880 --> 26:45.280
And version control with Git.

26:45.280 --> 26:48.080
Don't be relying on Google Drive or something.

26:48.160 --> 26:50.480
And learn Git via the command line.

26:50.480 --> 26:54.720
You don't have to learn VIM, but VIM helps when you're writing Markdown,

26:54.720 --> 26:57.600
and when basically when you're writing anything, VIM helps.

26:58.640 --> 27:01.840
Also, HTML is the future.

27:01.840 --> 27:06.000
HTML is so much better than PDF, PDF is slow, it sucks.

27:06.000 --> 27:10.720
And we need to stop like this format of like things have page breaks,

27:10.720 --> 27:12.240
and things are cut into pages.

27:12.240 --> 27:14.160
Nobody print stuff anymore.

27:14.560 --> 27:19.280
And additionally, you can print your HTML if you want it printed,

27:19.280 --> 27:21.600
and then you can get it in like a page format.

27:21.600 --> 27:25.360
I've done that whenever I'm making a cheat sheet for my classes,

27:25.360 --> 27:26.880
for my exams.

27:26.880 --> 27:29.200
I'll just write it all on HTML.

27:29.200 --> 27:31.120
Sometimes I'll even ask chat, GPT.

27:31.120 --> 27:33.760
I'll have all the material, I'll say, hey, put this into column,

27:33.760 --> 27:35.840
so it fits on a page nicely.

27:35.840 --> 27:39.200
I'm not going to write that in Google Word or Google Docs.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.600
Now, suddenly you write it in Google Docs in Google Word.

27:41.600 --> 27:43.600
You can't even fit as much stuff on the page

27:43.600 --> 27:45.760
as if you use HTML in the first place,

27:45.760 --> 27:48.240
and just use the print feature, right?

27:48.240 --> 27:49.760
You can print HTML.

27:49.760 --> 27:53.680
You can even specify specific styling for if you're printing.

27:54.400 --> 27:59.440
And then compare and contrast, like you're reading a textbook for your class,

27:59.440 --> 28:02.800
versus have you ever read like a nice medium article,

28:02.800 --> 28:08.400
or maybe someone in this channel has used LearnOpenGL.com.

28:08.400 --> 28:12.080
Like that is such a nice website, such a nice web resource.

28:12.080 --> 28:13.760
These web resources are so cool.

28:13.760 --> 28:17.920
They look nice, they make you feel like an epic gamer,

28:17.920 --> 28:19.680
just by scrolling the room.

28:20.640 --> 28:21.760
These are my takeaways.

28:21.760 --> 28:26.640
It took me a year to learn them, to learn Markdown, using Pandok,

28:26.640 --> 28:28.640
using Git via the command line,

28:28.640 --> 28:34.400
and also like December, Ish, I switched to my new keyboard layout,

28:34.400 --> 28:35.760
and I still use that.

28:35.760 --> 28:37.440
There's so many things you can do.

28:37.440 --> 28:39.680
Try installing Ubuntu, try to dual boot it.

28:39.680 --> 28:41.920
If you don't want to dual boot it, use the Windows

28:41.920 --> 28:44.880
subsystem Linux, or whatever it's called WSL, I think.

28:48.240 --> 28:52.640
Currently, I'm trying to set up a membership

28:52.640 --> 28:54.640
at Ben256.com.

28:55.840 --> 28:57.680
You can check out the website if you want,

28:57.680 --> 28:59.040
but there's no way to sign up.

28:59.040 --> 29:00.400
There's no way to support me there.

29:01.280 --> 29:04.480
But I do recommend if you want updates, go to Discord.

29:04.480 --> 29:08.400
Just don't be a butt head, but I will help you if you go to Discord.

29:08.400 --> 29:10.880
I'm helping people out all the time there,

29:10.880 --> 29:13.360
usually for procedural animation stuff.

29:13.360 --> 29:15.680
There's people in there who will help you out as well,

29:17.120 --> 29:21.680
and you can select Notify for live streams, YouTube uploads,

29:21.680 --> 29:23.840
for code, whatever you want in there.

29:23.840 --> 29:28.160
So you can really get granular with what kind of notifications you receive.
