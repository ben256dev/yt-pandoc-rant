1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
Any time I want to write something, lab reports, articles, math, tables, images, slideshows,

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,280
I use the same method, VIM, Markdown, and Pandog.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:18,960
A year ago, literally today, I had no VIM, no Linux, or Git command line experience.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,320
And today, I use Unix exclusively for all programming and document preparation.

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,880
Last year, I completely wiped Windows, and I switched 100% to Unix.

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,840
I use VIM specifically, uh, NeoVIM, just out of habit.

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,840
People told me to use NeoVIM, because it's got support for plugins and stuff.

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,160
I never installed plugins, but I still, I use VIM.

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,360
Just raw VIM.

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,400
My terminal is default.

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:53,120
There's no fancy colors, no skull, color scheme, nothing.

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,680
I even switched my keyboard layout to call MacDH with home raw mods, because I was so

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,520
serious about trying, uh, this attempt, right?

14
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:10,960
So a year ago, I was using Visual Studio, Microsoft Visual Studio, and trust me, I really

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,880
liked the hot keys in Microsoft Visual Studio.

16
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,760
I would do this alt arrow thing to move the line up and down.

17
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,360
You hold the control shift, and you can do multi-line editing, and stuff.

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,640
It was really nice, and I really liked the hot keys, uh, like even the most autistic

19
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,080
people in my major, I swear, in my computer science major, I knew the hot keys better

20
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,880
than them.

21
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:39,560
So it was a bum to move to VIM, and not be able to use those hot keys anymore.

22
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:47,880
But after I made the switch, I realized that I didn't need those hot keys.

23
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:55,080
The reason, let's back up, the reason why I made the switch is I was playing Civ5.

24
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:02,240
I didn't play a single video game for like a year, and I was starting to realize when

25
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:10,240
I was playing Civ5, that, uh, if I had the opportunity to, if I'm able to, I'm always

26
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,040
going to use hot keys.

27
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,320
There's never a moment where I'm like, oh, I'm not going to use hot keys, I'd rather

28
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,320
just use the mouse.

29
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,320
I know it, right?

30
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,960
So I kept, you know, you play Civ5 for long enough.

31
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,520
I have like a thousand hours in that game.

32
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,400
I was never a hot key, or keyboard wizard or nothing.

33
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:37,400
I was a FPS player, I liked using my mouse, I like clicking on stuff, but you do something

34
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
for long enough.

35
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,680
You start to gravitate towards the keyboard, it's just so natural and so nice to use the

36
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,680
keyboard.

37
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,360
Instead, you know, Civ5, Civ5 has an amazing UR, it's so nice to click on buttons.

38
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,840
Those buttons are so juicy in Civilization 5, and regardless, you know, every time I'm

39
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,880
building a farm, I'm like, this is so repetitive.

40
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:03,320
I have to click the farm button every time, and I start to realize every, about every

41
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:08,680
action in the game you can take with a unit, um, has a hot key, so you just hover over,

42
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,440
oh, you press I to build a farm.

43
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,440
Okay.

44
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,200
And then you slowly learn all the hot keys, like, for example, I could tell you right

45
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,200
now camp.

46
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,560
There's some fur, some little foxes running around in the hex, or there's a, uh, some

47
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:31,160
ivory, some elephants, H, H is to build a farm, uh, P for plantation, I think, uh, are

48
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,480
for road, you know, I remember, I think I remember a lot of these, I, for farm, I believe,

49
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,480
um, and I started to realize, like, you can't do everything with the mouse, but the

50
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,000
more you can do it, the keyboard, the better.

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,160
So I decided to adopt a more terminal centric full, I guess, another person who inspired

52
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:59,960
me to do this was, uh, I think his name is Soding Daily, TS Oding Daily, this Russian guy,

53
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,760
and I was watching him use, like, e-max and a bunch of other stuff, and I think that

54
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:11,920
was inspiring, like, oh, I could do this, another guy, um, there's 10, 10, 10, as this

55
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,920
guy's got long hair, he's from Scandinavia, or something I believe, and, um, he made

56
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,720
these videos where he did exclusively keyboard centric stuff.

57
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:30,880
In 10, 10's videos, he managed to do everything with the keyboard on his computer, and he

58
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,920
talked about Vimalot, and this is where I got introduced to the idea of using Vim, Vim is

59
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,680
a modal editor, right?

60
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,600
So Vim has certain modes where, like, if you mess up suddenly enter a different mode,

61
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,120
and you're not, like, in the text editor, like, you expect to be normally, you can't just

62
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,360
move around with the arrow keys.

63
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,480
In fact, in Vim, you're actively encouraged to not use the arrow keys, you're supposed to

64
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,960
use HJKL, right?

65
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,960
And then it turns out you're not supposed to use that either, necessarily, you're supposed

66
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:06,520
to learn word-based motions, sentence-based motions, paragraph-based motions, you're supposed

67
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,600
to get as efficient as possible, and take as many shortcuts as possible.

68
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,400
Now a lot of people switch to Unix because they don't want spyware, they don't want the

69
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:23,000
government to spy on or something or their edgy, or they want to write out their setup

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,720
and make it look cooler, I don't mess with any of that.

71
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,280
Like I said, I just use the default terminal, I do not care.

72
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,120
The reason why I use Unix is because I want package managers.

73
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,920
In Windows, I don't know, so many times, you're trying to install something in Windows,

74
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:44,400
and it's like, how do I, okay, do I get the installer for it, do I get the, do I do it with

75
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,200
the command line or script or what, and then it's just, it's so complicated.

76
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,600
Generally, in Unix, when I need something installed, it's just pseudo-apt installed, and

77
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,960
then the name of what I want, like Firefox, right, pseudo-apt install Firefox, pseudo-apt

78
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,960
install VLC.

79
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,960
Now I got VLC.

80
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,000
Now I got Firefox.

81
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,840
The other thing is like, you do install things on Windows, but sometimes just setting it up,

82
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,840
it just doesn't work.

83
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,240
Like I tried to, I remember trying to install Python on Windows, and it was such a pain,

84
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,920
like it was so hard to install Python, you would think that would be easy, right?

85
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:24,560
Let's address the alternative, and I used to use these two, of course, Google Docs.

86
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,200
Microsoft Word.

87
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:33,800
These are nice, because they are hosting your files remotely, and they kind of save stuff

88
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,600
very often, and of course, they have a lot of features, right?

89
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,160
You've got your equations and stuff, if you want to insert those, you can style stuff

90
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,560
however you want, but Mark Down is better, I'll tell you why.

91
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,520
So think about Google Docs, how many times have you been like working with your group

92
00:06:52,560 --> 00:07:00,760
mates, or maybe at work or something, and someone is just in there collaborating, and

93
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:06,960
they put like a stupid random indent, or they put an inconsistent heading, or they put

94
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,280
like an extra space, or they style like the font, like slightly different sizes, it's

95
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,840
so silly, right?

96
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:20,760
You're never going to need the feature to have one paragraph be a different size than

97
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,040
the other, right?

98
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,200
You're always going to be wanting to have your paragraph the same size.

99
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,440
You always want consistent headings.

100
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:35,920
I once had a teacher, and she was teaching a communications class, and she really emphasized

101
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,880
she wanted consistent formatting, and so we couldn't even use Google Docs.

102
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,520
We had to use Microsoft Word, because Microsoft Word was better about making the styling

103
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,120
consistent across headings.

104
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:54,120
So at the time, I remember thinking there's got to be a better solution to this, right?

105
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:00,080
Then going through all your headings and selecting them and setting the styling for them

106
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,600
and eventually making sure the consistent rise, it's silly, right?

107
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:11,000
The funny thing about Google Docs is Google Docs, eventually now Google Docs, lets you

108
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,320
write Mark Down in Google Docs.

109
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,000
If you put a hash into Google Docs, it'll be like, oh, you want a heading one, or if

110
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,800
you put, I think you can bold stuff with like, asterix and stuff, and it just goes to

111
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,920
show how helpful Mark Down is that even Google Docs uses it.

112
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:35,400
But here's the thing, I'll argue in this video that you should not be worrying about

113
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,200
your styling, you should be worrying about your writing, right?

114
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,520
That's what Mark Down enables you to do.

115
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,840
This syntax is simpler than anything you've ever used.

116
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,840
Mark Down syntax is so simple.

117
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,760
I write a whole Mark Down file, like my whole article or write up or whatever it is, and

118
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,120
then I basically compile it once or twice, and there's no mistakes, like you're not going

119
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,000
to say, oh, I made that huge mistake and then edited a bunch, it's minimal, it's minimal,

120
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,080
you just write something and it's so effortless, versus Google Docs, you have to stare

121
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,080
at the end styling of your product, and you have to worry about the styling, every time

122
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:20,760
you make something, well, the styling isn't going to change that much per assignment, or

123
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,000
per article, or thing you write.

124
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,200
Use your word about the styling later, write a template, Pandox supports templates, you

125
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,200
can have an HTML template file, and you can use that for any Mark Down file.

126
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,920
Pandox is so simple, right?

127
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:40,000
You just specify the output file format, or I mean, really, you just specify the output

128
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,360
file and it looks at the file extension and figures out what you need to convert it to.

129
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:54,360
You can also export to HTML or PDF, and when you export to HTML, you can embed images

130
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:01,360
in the HTML, so you get all the advantages of PDF minus the disadvantages of PDF.

131
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,800
PDF is slow, PDF sucks with, you have a page break all the time, right?

132
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,960
How many times have you been reading something, and then you have a figure, right?

133
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,160
And then it gets like put on a different page, and then you're supposed to like look

134
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,600
one or two pages ahead to view the figure, it's so stupid.

135
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,120
In the modern age, when everything is being viewed in the browser, we should just be using

136
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,160
HTML, this doesn't make sense to use PDF.

137
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:35,480
With HTML, if you want to embed an image, it's as simple as you add dash-embed dash resources

138
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,480
for Pandox.

139
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,040
Next, it's funny how people reinvent the wheel.

140
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:45,720
Like I see people talking all the time about, or not people, but like I've seen instances

141
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,920
where there's like these apps that are for writing, and the thing they're trying to sell

142
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,040
you is that, well, when you revise your writing, there's a lot of stuff you threw

143
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
away.

144
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,640
We'll save every version of everything you throw away so that you can compile it later

145
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,480
and make something out of your deleted writing.

146
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,760
And it's just so funny to hear people who don't know, well, we'll just call them normies

147
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:18,920
who don't know about Git, basically talking about like how they want Git, and you know,

148
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,240
a year ago, I wasn't that good at Git.

149
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,680
I was relying on GitHub desktop if I want to do something.

150
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,440
I had a class where we learned about version control, and I said, this is stupid.

151
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,520
Why do we have to do this with the command line when there's a GUI for it?

152
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,240
This is so like we're doing it the ancient way or whatever.

153
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,520
I had a class where we learned about Unix, and I had to do VIM tutor.

154
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,120
I had to learn VIM, and I was like, this is weird.

155
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,440
Why would I ever edit and VIM or whatever?

156
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,640
What is the point of this?

157
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,960
And I've slowly got humbled over time, and I have arguments with people who are stuck

158
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,680
in the first phase, the phase that I was in.

159
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:00,400
And they're like, oh, I like to get GUI because I could see it easier.

160
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,800
It's not as hard.

161
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,520
GitHub GUI is a nice application.

162
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:10,920
However, Git is like the perfect command line tool.

163
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:17,880
It's like, you know, it's like an example of what command line tools can be, how helpful,

164
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,120
and how useful, and how good they can look.

165
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,240
It's such a nice tool to use over the command line.

166
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,480
And if you're a computer science major or a programmer or a software engineer,

167
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,000
you have no excuse for not learning Git, read the command line.

168
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,160
Anytime you want to do anything complicated, you can't be searching for a little drop-down

169
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:46,000
menu or some item in a GUI and GitHub desktop when you need to check out a branch or

170
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,040
stash some stuff, or, I don't know, just amend a commit or something like you need to just,

171
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,720
it's not that hard.

172
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,160
I understand that it seems daunting, and it can be really boring to learn these tools

173
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,320
and really scary at first.

174
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,760
But trust, listen, I went a year, a year.

175
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,960
It took me a year to get to the point where I do so much stuff over the terminal.

176
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,840
And note that something else, I got a virtual private server.

177
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:19,680
A virtual private server, mines in Seattle, it's a computer that is remote on the cloud

178
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,760
that I can access anytime I want.

179
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:28,640
That's the advantage of using a terminal is that if it's running on Unix,

180
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,800
you can use SSH to access that terminal anywhere in the world.

181
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:39,440
I can get into that computer from an unrelated computer as long as I have the right password

182
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,720
and permissions and stuff.

183
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,440
It's kind of similar to how in Google Docs, you're like, oh, I'm so glad that I can go to the

184
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,600
browser and use this anywhere and I'll have access to my code.

185
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,240
Well, you have the same thing with Git.

186
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,960
You have the same thing if you have a VPS, right?

187
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,520
Because you can host your files wherever you want.

188
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:02,000
And in my experience, it's easier to host files on my VPS and share them.

189
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,920
So what I do on my VPS, I have a website.

190
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:13,440
It's at Ben256.com and what I like to do is I hash my files.

191
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,200
When you hash it generates a signature, it uniquely identifies the file.

192
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,520
That makes sure that I never have duplicates on my server.

193
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:27,520
Then I put that in the URL along with the file and I can send that to anyone.

194
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,960
And then they can just open it up like you go to Ben256.com.

195
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:38,960
The notes for this video are Ben256.com slash MarkdownRant.html.

196
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:45,600
There's also a MarkdownRant.md and that's just one example of how easy it is to share things.

197
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,680
And when I'm in the terminal, like we said earlier, it's so nice to be able to use a package manager.

198
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,040
I found out there's a program called QR and code.

199
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,840
You can sue to apps and install QR and code.

200
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,640
And then when you have your URL that you host on your website,

201
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:07,280
you just pipe it into QR and code and you can generate a QR code on your laptop.

202
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,160
And then you tell your lab partner, whoever you want to share it with,

203
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,280
hey, scan this on your phone and now they have it on their phone.

204
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,960
No emailing required.

205
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,280
If you don't want to be so specific and have a giant hash in the URL,

206
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:26,080
then you can just straight up put it on like Ben256.com MarkdownRant.html.

207
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:32,080
I didn't hash that or anything. I just stuck it on the website to make it convenient to use.

208
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:37,600
Now, personally, what I do is if I'm going to submit an assignment,

209
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,880
and again, to reiterate, I submitted every single assignment using Markdown.

210
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,400
I haven't submitted any assignments using Google Docs or nothing or anything else.

211
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,640
Whenever they ask for PDF, PDF is a stupid format.

212
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,840
And sometimes, especially if you have a lot of images, it can look really bad in a PDF.

213
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,200
Even if Pam Doc converts it, it does it's best, right?

214
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,240
But if you have a ton of images, they're not going to all fit on one page.

215
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,320
And PDF has the stupid thing where there's page breaks all the time,

216
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,920
as if you're going to print it or something, nobody prints anything anymore.

217
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,320
So it's okay, what you do, the PDF version can be inferior.

218
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:25,520
And you can upload that to your course website or whoever needs the PDF.

219
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:32,320
But then, you just put a link in the PDF and link to your HTML version, which is superior,

220
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,000
or I go in the comments of my submission. I say, hey, check out the HTML version.

221
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,320
It's better, even though you ask for a PDF, I gave you one, but the HTML is better.

222
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,840
You might as well read that. And then, I never get any concerns for my greater.

223
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,480
Like, I can't read this because the figures are hard to read.

224
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,720
No, there's an HTML version.

225
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,960
And the HTML version looks so good.

226
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:58,160
Pandox, default conversion and the styling for HTML looks just good enough.

227
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,000
Like, there's nothing wrong with it.

228
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,760
You can even do slides in HTML using Pandox.

229
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,680
And the library is revealed.js.

230
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:14,480
And these slides, let me tell you, these slides are superior in every way.

231
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,880
It's a PowerPoint format or whatever.

232
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,640
Because when you export PowerPoint, your browser doesn't open that easily, right?

233
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,880
So what you end up doing is, I just had a class where the teacher, he converted his slides

234
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,440
the PowerPoint format into PDF.

235
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,960
So then, you had to constantly download this stupid huge PDF.

236
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,520
And it was just a waste, right?

237
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:45,680
Versus HTML, HTML is faster than PDF and just so much more convenient, right?

238
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,360
That's what the browser is for.

239
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,800
How many times are you going to download a PDF file?

240
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:56,000
PDF, PDF, parentheses one, PDF parentheses two, parentheses three,

241
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,600
parentheses four. How many times am I going to download this file?

242
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,640
If I'm just going to delete it, like, I have to remember to delete it.

243
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,160
That's what the browser is for.

244
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,880
That's why you serve files statically on a website.

245
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,240
HTML slides are epic.

246
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,680
And they look cooler.

247
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,440
They look more professional and more epic, or, okay, objectively.

248
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,960
Now, a lot of people do static site generation.

249
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:28,800
What that is, basically, is people don't want to have to write raw HTML.

250
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,880
Every time they make a new article, of course.

251
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,480
So, what some people do, well, some people, they do just write HTML.

252
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,600
And that's kind of cringe.

253
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,880
There's this really cool guy. I really like this guy.

254
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,680
He's like a bipolar schizophrenic guy and he's bald.

255
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,600
And his name is Luke Smith and he's like afraid of the government.

256
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,120
So he lives in the woods.

257
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,960
But he has a really excellent tutorial on how to set up your website.

258
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,960
And that's what I followed to set up my website with my VPS and stuff.

259
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,600
And he was a big advocate.

260
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,120
He started making this video.

261
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,080
He was like, look, I'm not to start writing raw HTML.

262
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,440
And it's such a pain to write HTML, like, playing.

263
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,960
Especially if you're doing a lot of it.

264
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,360
Every time you need a paragraph, you need to put a P tag.

265
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,560
It's so goofy.

266
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,400
That's what markdown is for.

267
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,280
You don't want to be opening a tag, enclosing your tag,

268
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:24,720
and making sure you have a right tag, and then writing your HTML boiler

269
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,280
plate. That's what Pandok handles that for you.

270
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,680
That's what the dash s, the dash dash stand alone flag does in Pandok.

271
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,160
It gives you boiler plate for your HTML.

272
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,000
Converse your markdown into HTML, semantic HTML.

273
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,360
Now, I also, I had a friend who he decided he was going to make a static site.

274
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,720
And he was going to generate it.

275
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,400
He's going to do a static site generator.

276
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,800
And I don't know why people do this.

277
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,480
I've seen a lot of programmers doing this.

278
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,560
They think, oh, I'm a programmer.

279
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,480
I'm going to write it in markdown.

280
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,160
And I'm going to convert it to HTML myself.

281
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,880
Guys, we don't need to reinvent the wheel.

282
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,200
Pandok does everything for us.

283
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,840
If you don't like the styling, that's why you use an HTML template.

284
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,160
And all it does is it does substitution.

285
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,480
It substitutes the text and puts it into the HTML template

286
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,200
that you provide with the styling that you want.

287
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,560
I'll give you an example.

288
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,960
If you go to Ben256.com slash read, I published a bunch of public domain

289
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,320
Plato texts from like Plato, the philosopher.

290
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,000
I was trying to get my friends to replay it.

291
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,760
And it didn't really work.

292
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,520
However, what you could do with this, right?

293
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,960
You can see the site.

294
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,840
I added in a little bar that scrolls.

295
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,960
It shows the completion.

296
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,040
Like how much you've read the article.

297
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,560
I added in a nav that is like statically generated.

298
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,440
There is whenever I update the pages,

299
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,280
there's like an automatic script that runs and updates the last updated.

300
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,040
It's so nice.

301
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,800
There's even footnotes are supported through Markdown.

302
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,360
If you use Pandok, it's so awesome.

303
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,640
And then everything as the right styling, everything looks nice.

304
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,520
You compare that to where I got the source material.

305
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,800
I went to Project Gutenberg and these websites.

306
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,880
Therefore, archival purposes.

307
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,680
They're not for like reading the whole text, right?

308
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,520
They suck for that because they have like these terrible old sites.

309
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,280
They're like horrible to read.

310
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,440
So what you do, or what I did, is I went and I got the UTF8 for it.

311
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,400
I just copied it.

312
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,000
I did a, this tiny little bit of like edits in a VIM to make it

313
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,960
a correctly formatted Markdown file.

314
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,400
Put in a little bit of metadata, title author translator.

315
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,040
And then I just run a script like I do on every other

316
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,040
Plato text that I've uploaded.

317
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,560
So if you go to Ben256.com slash read, you can see that.

318
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,160
And you can see an example of me,

319
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,320
everything I wrote there is Markdown.

320
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,120
Finally, we have to talk about Lawtech.

321
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:08,480
Lawtech in some ways is important mainly for math equations.

322
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,840
In other ways, it's like a worse version of Markdown.

323
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,360
So I've seen graduate students, they write

324
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,360
entire documents in Lawtech.

325
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,360
And hopefully they're using templates.

326
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,520
If not, they probably want to kill themselves.

327
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,280
Because Lawtech, it has all these slash begins, slash

328
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,760
and use package or like whatever.

329
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,320
There's so much garbage in Lawtech.

330
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,240
Like just to make like an unordered list or something,

331
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,200
it takes so much effort mentally and so much,

332
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,720
you have to remember so much like you might as well just ask AI

333
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,880
to write the Lawtech document for you.

334
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,800
If you're going to write something yourself,

335
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,400
don't write it in Lawtech.

336
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,320
If you want math equations,

337
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,960
well also don't use Google Docs and like go and look through a big menu

338
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,320
with like a big table like, oh, where's my, how do I make a fraction?

339
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
Oh, I got to go look for the fraction.

340
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,000
Oh, I got to do the square root.

341
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,720
Instead of doing the goofy parts of Lawtech in Lawtech,

342
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,680
do all the goofy parts of Lawtech in Markdown.

343
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,160
Using Pandok, you can embed Lawtech into your Markdown.

344
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,000
So you get all the upsides of Lawtech.

345
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,200
You can put Lawtech equations into your Markdown.

346
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,600
And then you don't have to do titles or headings with Lawtech.

347
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,600
If you want to be a boomer and write your whole page in just raw HTML,

348
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,680
well, you also don't have an excuse for not using Markdown in Pandok.

349
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,160
You can embed HTML into your Markdown.

350
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,400
If a template isn't working for you, finally,

351
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,920
how many times have you seen a code example in a PDF or something,

352
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,160
especially if you're like a college, like a CS major, right?

353
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,240
The professors, they're always putting these.

354
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,480
They just put these like black and white, like they paste code into Google Docs

355
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,840
and it's black and white.

356
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,560
It's not even, sometimes it's not even mono space.

357
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,560
And there's no syntax highlighting.

358
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,400
This is so goofy.

359
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,320
There's an obvious solution and they just don't bother to find it.

360
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:10,880
Okay.

361
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:17,840
The solution is the same thing that your read me uses on GitHub.

362
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,240
When you have a GitHub read me, you write Markdown and you put your code in.

363
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,440
And you do like three backs, backticks.

364
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:31,920
And then you put the name of the programming language that the code is made out of, right?

365
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,640
And then the GitHub interprets the GitHub interpreter

366
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,680
for the Markdown converts it into HTML or PDF,

367
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,520
or I guess you could get a PDF or whatever.

368
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,800
It does that with correct syntax highlighting for the language.

369
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,360
You can do that with Pandok and Markdown.

370
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,000
You don't need GitHub's version or whatever.

371
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,640
I do this.

372
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,200
I've done this a million times every time I put code in,

373
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,480
I specify the language into the Markdown file.

374
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,400
I embed that code in there.

375
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,000
And then when I export it as HTML, it looks beautiful.

376
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,560
It's correctly syntax highlights it.

377
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,760
It's all mono space, or yeah, it's all mono space.

378
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,760
PDF, PDF sometimes breaks if you have really wide code like a comment.

379
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,440
It's like goes on forever.

380
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,600
But if you export as HTML, you use the standalone flag.

381
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,000
It'll give you a scrollable region.

382
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,520
So it'll get cut off.

383
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,480
But if you want to see the rest of the line, you can scroll horizontally.

384
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,520
So I want to emphasize, like if I wish I had a book to write,

385
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,440
I wish I was like some kind of novelist or author or something,

386
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,200
because it is so enjoyable writing Markdown.

387
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,960
Every time I write Markdown, I'm just, I'm going to climax when I write Markdown, okay?

388
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,600
We got to stop writing inward or docs, okay?

389
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,880
Especially as programmers, it's cringe.

390
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,080
We got to stop doing this.

391
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,760
We shouldn't be rewriting static site generators.

392
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,960
When Pandok does it for us, it's, I installed it once,

393
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,800
and it's amazing and beautiful.

394
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,680
And then next time you're going to make some slides,

395
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,040
consider using Pandok.

396
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,840
Next time you're going to make a website, go ask chat,

397
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,760
Hey, chat, GPT, how do I convert Markdown into HTML with a nice template

398
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,160
so that my HTML styling looks nice?

399
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,080
And just have it generated in an example template,

400
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,640
and then mess with it until you like the styling.

401
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,040
Always use Markdown for, for any writing you do,

402
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,640
because it's distraction free.

403
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,920
You don't have to worry about the styling.

404
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,880
You just spit out some Markdown.

405
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,280
And version control with Git.

406
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,080
Don't be relying on Google Drive or something.

407
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,480
And learn Git via the command line.

408
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,720
You don't have to learn VIM, but VIM helps when you're writing Markdown,

409
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,600
and when basically when you're writing anything, VIM helps.

410
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,840
Also, HTML is the future.

411
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,000
HTML is so much better than PDF, PDF is slow, it sucks.

412
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,720
And we need to stop like this format of like things have page breaks,

413
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,240
and things are cut into pages.

414
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,160
Nobody print stuff anymore.

415
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:19,280
And additionally, you can print your HTML if you want it printed,

416
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,600
and then you can get it in like a page format.

417
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,360
I've done that whenever I'm making a cheat sheet for my classes,

418
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,880
for my exams.

419
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,200
I'll just write it all on HTML.

420
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,120
Sometimes I'll even ask chat, GPT.

421
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,760
I'll have all the material, I'll say, hey, put this into column,

422
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,840
so it fits on a page nicely.

423
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,200
I'm not going to write that in Google Word or Google Docs.

424
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,600
Now, suddenly you write it in Google Docs in Google Word.

425
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
You can't even fit as much stuff on the page

426
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,760
as if you use HTML in the first place,

427
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,240
and just use the print feature, right?

428
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,760
You can print HTML.

429
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,680
You can even specify specific styling for if you're printing.

430
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:59,440
And then compare and contrast, like you're reading a textbook for your class,

431
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,800
versus have you ever read like a nice medium article,

432
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:08,400
or maybe someone in this channel has used LearnOpenGL.com.

433
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,080
Like that is such a nice website, such a nice web resource.

434
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,760
These web resources are so cool.

435
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,920
They look nice, they make you feel like an epic gamer,

436
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,680
just by scrolling the room.

437
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,760
These are my takeaways.

438
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,640
It took me a year to learn them, to learn Markdown, using Pandok,

439
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,640
using Git via the command line,

440
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:34,400
and also like December, Ish, I switched to my new keyboard layout,

441
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,760
and I still use that.

442
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,440
There's so many things you can do.

443
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,680
Try installing Ubuntu, try to dual boot it.

444
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,920
If you don't want to dual boot it, use the Windows

445
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,880
subsystem Linux, or whatever it's called WSL, I think.

446
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,640
Currently, I'm trying to set up a membership

447
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,640
at Ben256.com.

448
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,680
You can check out the website if you want,

449
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,040
but there's no way to sign up.

450
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,400
There's no way to support me there.

451
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,480
But I do recommend if you want updates, go to Discord.

452
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,400
Just don't be a butt head, but I will help you if you go to Discord.

453
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,880
I'm helping people out all the time there,

454
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,360
usually for procedural animation stuff.

455
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,680
There's people in there who will help you out as well,

456
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,680
and you can select Notify for live streams, YouTube uploads,

457
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,840
for code, whatever you want in there.

458
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,160
So you can really get granular with what kind of notifications you receive.
