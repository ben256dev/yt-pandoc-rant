0	7120	Any time I want to write something, lab reports, articles, math, tables, images, slideshows,
7120	11280	I use the same method, VIM, Markdown, and Pandog.
11280	18960	A year ago, literally today, I had no VIM, no Linux, or Git command line experience.
18960	25320	And today, I use Unix exclusively for all programming and document preparation.
25320	30880	Last year, I completely wiped Windows, and I switched 100% to Unix.
30880	35840	I use VIM specifically, uh, NeoVIM, just out of habit.
35840	40840	People told me to use NeoVIM, because it's got support for plugins and stuff.
40840	44160	I never installed plugins, but I still, I use VIM.
44160	45360	Just raw VIM.
45360	47400	My terminal is default.
47400	53120	There's no fancy colors, no skull, color scheme, nothing.
53120	59680	I even switched my keyboard layout to call MacDH with home raw mods, because I was so
59680	64520	serious about trying, uh, this attempt, right?
64520	70960	So a year ago, I was using Visual Studio, Microsoft Visual Studio, and trust me, I really
70960	73880	liked the hot keys in Microsoft Visual Studio.
73880	77760	I would do this alt arrow thing to move the line up and down.
77760	81360	You hold the control shift, and you can do multi-line editing, and stuff.
81360	86640	It was really nice, and I really liked the hot keys, uh, like even the most autistic
86640	92080	people in my major, I swear, in my computer science major, I knew the hot keys better
92080	93880	than them.
93880	99560	So it was a bum to move to VIM, and not be able to use those hot keys anymore.
99560	107880	But after I made the switch, I realized that I didn't need those hot keys.
107880	115080	The reason, let's back up, the reason why I made the switch is I was playing Civ5.
115080	122240	I didn't play a single video game for like a year, and I was starting to realize when
122240	130240	I was playing Civ5, that, uh, if I had the opportunity to, if I'm able to, I'm always
130240	132040	going to use hot keys.
132040	135320	There's never a moment where I'm like, oh, I'm not going to use hot keys, I'd rather
135320	136320	just use the mouse.
136320	138320	I know it, right?
138320	140960	So I kept, you know, you play Civ5 for long enough.
140960	143520	I have like a thousand hours in that game.
143520	147400	I was never a hot key, or keyboard wizard or nothing.
147400	157400	I was a FPS player, I liked using my mouse, I like clicking on stuff, but you do something
157400	158400	for long enough.
158400	162680	You start to gravitate towards the keyboard, it's just so natural and so nice to use the
162680	163680	keyboard.
163680	169360	Instead, you know, Civ5, Civ5 has an amazing UR, it's so nice to click on buttons.
169360	175840	Those buttons are so juicy in Civilization 5, and regardless, you know, every time I'm
175840	177880	building a farm, I'm like, this is so repetitive.
177880	183320	I have to click the farm button every time, and I start to realize every, about every
183320	188680	action in the game you can take with a unit, um, has a hot key, so you just hover over,
188680	190440	oh, you press I to build a farm.
190440	191440	Okay.
191440	196200	And then you slowly learn all the hot keys, like, for example, I could tell you right
196200	198200	now camp.
198200	203560	There's some fur, some little foxes running around in the hex, or there's a, uh, some
203560	211160	ivory, some elephants, H, H is to build a farm, uh, P for plantation, I think, uh, are
211160	216480	for road, you know, I remember, I think I remember a lot of these, I, for farm, I believe,
217480	222480	um, and I started to realize, like, you can't do everything with the mouse, but the
222480	225000	more you can do it, the keyboard, the better.
225000	232160	So I decided to adopt a more terminal centric full, I guess, another person who inspired
232160	239960	me to do this was, uh, I think his name is Soding Daily, TS Oding Daily, this Russian guy,
239960	243760	and I was watching him use, like, e-max and a bunch of other stuff, and I think that
243760	251920	was inspiring, like, oh, I could do this, another guy, um, there's 10, 10, 10, as this
251920	257920	guy's got long hair, he's from Scandinavia, or something I believe, and, um, he made
257920	262720	these videos where he did exclusively keyboard centric stuff.
262720	270880	In 10, 10's videos, he managed to do everything with the keyboard on his computer, and he
270880	274920	talked about Vimalot, and this is where I got introduced to the idea of using Vim, Vim is
274920	276680	a modal editor, right?
276680	281600	So Vim has certain modes where, like, if you mess up suddenly enter a different mode,
281600	286120	and you're not, like, in the text editor, like, you expect to be normally, you can't just
286120	288360	move around with the arrow keys.
288360	292480	In fact, in Vim, you're actively encouraged to not use the arrow keys, you're supposed to
292480	294960	use HJKL, right?
294960	298960	And then it turns out you're not supposed to use that either, necessarily, you're supposed
298960	306520	to learn word-based motions, sentence-based motions, paragraph-based motions, you're supposed
306520	311600	to get as efficient as possible, and take as many shortcuts as possible.
311600	317400	Now a lot of people switch to Unix because they don't want spyware, they don't want the
317400	323000	government to spy on or something or their edgy, or they want to write out their setup
323000	325720	and make it look cooler, I don't mess with any of that.
325720	329280	Like I said, I just use the default terminal, I do not care.
329280	334120	The reason why I use Unix is because I want package managers.
334120	338920	In Windows, I don't know, so many times, you're trying to install something in Windows,
338920	344400	and it's like, how do I, okay, do I get the installer for it, do I get the, do I do it with
344400	349200	the command line or script or what, and then it's just, it's so complicated.
349200	354600	Generally, in Unix, when I need something installed, it's just pseudo-apt installed, and
354600	359960	then the name of what I want, like Firefox, right, pseudo-apt install Firefox, pseudo-apt
359960	360960	install VLC.
360960	361960	Now I got VLC.
361960	364000	Now I got Firefox.
364000	369840	The other thing is like, you do install things on Windows, but sometimes just setting it up,
369840	370840	it just doesn't work.
370840	374240	Like I tried to, I remember trying to install Python on Windows, and it was such a pain,
374240	378920	like it was so hard to install Python, you would think that would be easy, right?
378920	384560	Let's address the alternative, and I used to use these two, of course, Google Docs.
384600	386200	Microsoft Word.
386200	393800	These are nice, because they are hosting your files remotely, and they kind of save stuff
393800	397600	very often, and of course, they have a lot of features, right?
397600	401160	You've got your equations and stuff, if you want to insert those, you can style stuff
401160	406560	however you want, but Mark Down is better, I'll tell you why.
406560	412520	So think about Google Docs, how many times have you been like working with your group
412560	420760	mates, or maybe at work or something, and someone is just in there collaborating, and
420760	426960	they put like a stupid random indent, or they put an inconsistent heading, or they put
426960	432280	like an extra space, or they style like the font, like slightly different sizes, it's
432280	433840	so silly, right?
433840	440760	You're never going to need the feature to have one paragraph be a different size than
440760	442040	the other, right?
442040	445200	You're always going to be wanting to have your paragraph the same size.
445200	447440	You always want consistent headings.
447440	455920	I once had a teacher, and she was teaching a communications class, and she really emphasized
455920	460880	she wanted consistent formatting, and so we couldn't even use Google Docs.
460880	465520	We had to use Microsoft Word, because Microsoft Word was better about making the styling
465520	468120	consistent across headings.
468120	474120	So at the time, I remember thinking there's got to be a better solution to this, right?
474120	480080	Then going through all your headings and selecting them and setting the styling for them
480080	484600	and eventually making sure the consistent rise, it's silly, right?
484600	491000	The funny thing about Google Docs is Google Docs, eventually now Google Docs, lets you
491000	493320	write Mark Down in Google Docs.
493360	498000	If you put a hash into Google Docs, it'll be like, oh, you want a heading one, or if
498000	503800	you put, I think you can bold stuff with like, asterix and stuff, and it just goes to
503800	508920	show how helpful Mark Down is that even Google Docs uses it.
508920	515400	But here's the thing, I'll argue in this video that you should not be worrying about
515400	519200	your styling, you should be worrying about your writing, right?
519200	521520	That's what Mark Down enables you to do.
521520	525840	This syntax is simpler than anything you've ever used.
525840	527840	Mark Down syntax is so simple.
527840	532760	I write a whole Mark Down file, like my whole article or write up or whatever it is, and
532760	537120	then I basically compile it once or twice, and there's no mistakes, like you're not going
537120	543000	to say, oh, I made that huge mistake and then edited a bunch, it's minimal, it's minimal,
543000	549080	you just write something and it's so effortless, versus Google Docs, you have to stare
549080	553080	at the end styling of your product, and you have to worry about the styling, every time
553080	560760	you make something, well, the styling isn't going to change that much per assignment, or
560760	563000	per article, or thing you write.
563000	567200	Use your word about the styling later, write a template, Pandox supports templates, you
567200	572200	can have an HTML template file, and you can use that for any Mark Down file.
572200	573920	Pandox is so simple, right?
573920	580000	You just specify the output file format, or I mean, really, you just specify the output
580000	586360	file and it looks at the file extension and figures out what you need to convert it to.
586360	594360	You can also export to HTML or PDF, and when you export to HTML, you can embed images
594360	601360	in the HTML, so you get all the advantages of PDF minus the disadvantages of PDF.
601360	606800	PDF is slow, PDF sucks with, you have a page break all the time, right?
606800	611960	How many times have you been reading something, and then you have a figure, right?
611960	615160	And then it gets like put on a different page, and then you're supposed to like look
615160	619600	one or two pages ahead to view the figure, it's so stupid.
619600	625120	In the modern age, when everything is being viewed in the browser, we should just be using
625120	628160	HTML, this doesn't make sense to use PDF.
628160	635480	With HTML, if you want to embed an image, it's as simple as you add dash-embed dash resources
635480	636480	for Pandox.
636480	640040	Next, it's funny how people reinvent the wheel.
640040	645720	Like I see people talking all the time about, or not people, but like I've seen instances
645720	651920	where there's like these apps that are for writing, and the thing they're trying to sell
651920	657040	you is that, well, when you revise your writing, there's a lot of stuff you threw
657040	658040	away.
658040	662640	We'll save every version of everything you throw away so that you can compile it later
662640	666480	and make something out of your deleted writing.
666480	672760	And it's just so funny to hear people who don't know, well, we'll just call them normies
672760	678920	who don't know about Git, basically talking about like how they want Git, and you know,
678920	681240	a year ago, I wasn't that good at Git.
681240	684680	I was relying on GitHub desktop if I want to do something.
684760	689440	I had a class where we learned about version control, and I said, this is stupid.
689440	692520	Why do we have to do this with the command line when there's a GUI for it?
692520	695240	This is so like we're doing it the ancient way or whatever.
695240	699520	I had a class where we learned about Unix, and I had to do VIM tutor.
699520	702120	I had to learn VIM, and I was like, this is weird.
702120	704440	Why would I ever edit and VIM or whatever?
704440	706640	What is the point of this?
706640	711960	And I've slowly got humbled over time, and I have arguments with people who are stuck
712040	714680	in the first phase, the phase that I was in.
714680	720400	And they're like, oh, I like to get GUI because I could see it easier.
720400	721800	It's not as hard.
721800	724520	GitHub GUI is a nice application.
724520	730920	However, Git is like the perfect command line tool.
730920	737880	It's like, you know, it's like an example of what command line tools can be, how helpful,
737880	741120	and how useful, and how good they can look.
741200	744240	It's such a nice tool to use over the command line.
744240	748480	And if you're a computer science major or a programmer or a software engineer,
748480	752000	you have no excuse for not learning Git, read the command line.
752000	758160	Anytime you want to do anything complicated, you can't be searching for a little drop-down
758160	766000	menu or some item in a GUI and GitHub desktop when you need to check out a branch or
766080	771040	stash some stuff, or, I don't know, just amend a commit or something like you need to just,
771040	772720	it's not that hard.
772720	778160	I understand that it seems daunting, and it can be really boring to learn these tools
778160	780320	and really scary at first.
780320	783760	But trust, listen, I went a year, a year.
783760	788960	It took me a year to get to the point where I do so much stuff over the terminal.
788960	793840	And note that something else, I got a virtual private server.
793840	799680	A virtual private server, mines in Seattle, it's a computer that is remote on the cloud
799680	801760	that I can access anytime I want.
801760	808640	That's the advantage of using a terminal is that if it's running on Unix,
808640	812800	you can use SSH to access that terminal anywhere in the world.
812800	819440	I can get into that computer from an unrelated computer as long as I have the right password
819440	820720	and permissions and stuff.
820720	825440	It's kind of similar to how in Google Docs, you're like, oh, I'm so glad that I can go to the
825440	829600	browser and use this anywhere and I'll have access to my code.
829600	832240	Well, you have the same thing with Git.
832240	834960	You have the same thing if you have a VPS, right?
834960	837520	Because you can host your files wherever you want.
837520	842000	And in my experience, it's easier to host files on my VPS and share them.
842000	845920	So what I do on my VPS, I have a website.
845920	853440	It's at Ben256.com and what I like to do is I hash my files.
853440	857200	When you hash it generates a signature, it uniquely identifies the file.
858160	861520	That makes sure that I never have duplicates on my server.
861520	867520	Then I put that in the URL along with the file and I can send that to anyone.
867520	870960	And then they can just open it up like you go to Ben256.com.
871920	878960	The notes for this video are Ben256.com slash MarkdownRant.html.
878960	885600	There's also a MarkdownRant.md and that's just one example of how easy it is to share things.
885600	891680	And when I'm in the terminal, like we said earlier, it's so nice to be able to use a package manager.
891680	895040	I found out there's a program called QR and code.
895120	897840	You can sue to apps and install QR and code.
897840	902640	And then when you have your URL that you host on your website,
902640	907280	you just pipe it into QR and code and you can generate a QR code on your laptop.
907280	910160	And then you tell your lab partner, whoever you want to share it with,
910160	913280	hey, scan this on your phone and now they have it on their phone.
913280	914960	No emailing required.
914960	919280	If you don't want to be so specific and have a giant hash in the URL,
919280	926080	then you can just straight up put it on like Ben256.com MarkdownRant.html.
926080	932080	I didn't hash that or anything. I just stuck it on the website to make it convenient to use.
932080	937600	Now, personally, what I do is if I'm going to submit an assignment,
937600	942880	and again, to reiterate, I submitted every single assignment using Markdown.
942880	948400	I haven't submitted any assignments using Google Docs or nothing or anything else.
948480	952640	Whenever they ask for PDF, PDF is a stupid format.
952640	957840	And sometimes, especially if you have a lot of images, it can look really bad in a PDF.
958400	961200	Even if Pam Doc converts it, it does it's best, right?
962320	966240	But if you have a ton of images, they're not going to all fit on one page.
966240	970320	And PDF has the stupid thing where there's page breaks all the time,
970320	973920	as if you're going to print it or something, nobody prints anything anymore.
973920	978320	So it's okay, what you do, the PDF version can be inferior.
978880	985520	And you can upload that to your course website or whoever needs the PDF.
985520	992320	But then, you just put a link in the PDF and link to your HTML version, which is superior,
992320	996000	or I go in the comments of my submission. I say, hey, check out the HTML version.
996000	1000320	It's better, even though you ask for a PDF, I gave you one, but the HTML is better.
1000320	1005840	You might as well read that. And then, I never get any concerns for my greater.
1005840	1008480	Like, I can't read this because the figures are hard to read.
1008480	1010720	No, there's an HTML version.
1010720	1012960	And the HTML version looks so good.
1012960	1018160	Pandox, default conversion and the styling for HTML looks just good enough.
1018160	1020000	Like, there's nothing wrong with it.
1020000	1025760	You can even do slides in HTML using Pandox.
1026720	1029680	And the library is revealed.js.
1029680	1034480	And these slides, let me tell you, these slides are superior in every way.
1034480	1036880	It's a PowerPoint format or whatever.
1036880	1042640	Because when you export PowerPoint, your browser doesn't open that easily, right?
1042640	1048880	So what you end up doing is, I just had a class where the teacher, he converted his slides
1048880	1051440	the PowerPoint format into PDF.
1051600	1056960	So then, you had to constantly download this stupid huge PDF.
1056960	1059520	And it was just a waste, right?
1059520	1065680	Versus HTML, HTML is faster than PDF and just so much more convenient, right?
1065680	1067360	That's what the browser is for.
1067360	1070800	How many times are you going to download a PDF file?
1070800	1076000	PDF, PDF, parentheses one, PDF parentheses two, parentheses three,
1076000	1079600	parentheses four. How many times am I going to download this file?
1079600	1082640	If I'm just going to delete it, like, I have to remember to delete it.
1082640	1084160	That's what the browser is for.
1084160	1086880	That's why you serve files statically on a website.
1088400	1090240	HTML slides are epic.
1090240	1091680	And they look cooler.
1091680	1095440	They look more professional and more epic, or, okay, objectively.
1096080	1100960	Now, a lot of people do static site generation.
1101760	1108800	What that is, basically, is people don't want to have to write raw HTML.
1108800	1110880	Every time they make a new article, of course.
1111520	1116480	So, what some people do, well, some people, they do just write HTML.
1116480	1117600	And that's kind of cringe.
1118560	1120880	There's this really cool guy. I really like this guy.
1120880	1125680	He's like a bipolar schizophrenic guy and he's bald.
1126240	1129600	And his name is Luke Smith and he's like afraid of the government.
1129600	1131120	So he lives in the woods.
1131120	1134960	But he has a really excellent tutorial on how to set up your website.
1135040	1138960	And that's what I followed to set up my website with my VPS and stuff.
1139680	1141600	And he was a big advocate.
1141600	1143120	He started making this video.
1143120	1146080	He was like, look, I'm not to start writing raw HTML.
1146080	1149440	And it's such a pain to write HTML, like, playing.
1149440	1150960	Especially if you're doing a lot of it.
1150960	1153360	Every time you need a paragraph, you need to put a P tag.
1153360	1154560	It's so goofy.
1154560	1156400	That's what markdown is for.
1156400	1159280	You don't want to be opening a tag, enclosing your tag,
1159280	1164720	and making sure you have a right tag, and then writing your HTML boiler
1164720	1167280	plate. That's what Pandok handles that for you.
1167280	1171680	That's what the dash s, the dash dash stand alone flag does in Pandok.
1171680	1174160	It gives you boiler plate for your HTML.
1174160	1178000	Converse your markdown into HTML, semantic HTML.
1178000	1183360	Now, I also, I had a friend who he decided he was going to make a static site.
1183360	1184720	And he was going to generate it.
1184720	1186400	He's going to do a static site generator.
1187120	1188800	And I don't know why people do this.
1188800	1190480	I've seen a lot of programmers doing this.
1190480	1192560	They think, oh, I'm a programmer.
1192640	1194480	I'm going to write it in markdown.
1194480	1198160	And I'm going to convert it to HTML myself.
1198160	1200880	Guys, we don't need to reinvent the wheel.
1200880	1203200	Pandok does everything for us.
1203200	1207840	If you don't like the styling, that's why you use an HTML template.
1207840	1210160	And all it does is it does substitution.
1210160	1214480	It substitutes the text and puts it into the HTML template
1214480	1217200	that you provide with the styling that you want.
1217200	1218560	I'll give you an example.
1218640	1224960	If you go to Ben256.com slash read, I published a bunch of public domain
1224960	1228320	Plato texts from like Plato, the philosopher.
1228320	1230000	I was trying to get my friends to replay it.
1230000	1231760	And it didn't really work.
1231760	1235520	However, what you could do with this, right?
1235520	1236960	You can see the site.
1236960	1239840	I added in a little bar that scrolls.
1239840	1240960	It shows the completion.
1240960	1243040	Like how much you've read the article.
1243040	1246560	I added in a nav that is like statically generated.
1246960	1251440	There is whenever I update the pages,
1251440	1255280	there's like an automatic script that runs and updates the last updated.
1256320	1257040	It's so nice.
1257040	1260800	There's even footnotes are supported through Markdown.
1260800	1263360	If you use Pandok, it's so awesome.
1263360	1266640	And then everything as the right styling, everything looks nice.
1266640	1271520	You compare that to where I got the source material.
1271520	1274800	I went to Project Gutenberg and these websites.
1274880	1276880	Therefore, archival purposes.
1276880	1279680	They're not for like reading the whole text, right?
1279680	1283520	They suck for that because they have like these terrible old sites.
1283520	1285280	They're like horrible to read.
1285280	1289440	So what you do, or what I did, is I went and I got the UTF8 for it.
1289440	1290400	I just copied it.
1290400	1296000	I did a, this tiny little bit of like edits in a VIM to make it
1296000	1298960	a correctly formatted Markdown file.
1298960	1302400	Put in a little bit of metadata, title author translator.
1303360	1307040	And then I just run a script like I do on every other
1307040	1309040	Plato text that I've uploaded.
1309040	1312560	So if you go to Ben256.com slash read, you can see that.
1312560	1316160	And you can see an example of me,
1316160	1318320	everything I wrote there is Markdown.
1318320	1321120	Finally, we have to talk about Lawtech.
1321120	1328480	Lawtech in some ways is important mainly for math equations.
1328480	1331840	In other ways, it's like a worse version of Markdown.
1331840	1335360	So I've seen graduate students, they write
1335360	1337360	entire documents in Lawtech.
1337360	1339360	And hopefully they're using templates.
1339360	1341520	If not, they probably want to kill themselves.
1341520	1345280	Because Lawtech, it has all these slash begins, slash
1345280	1347760	and use package or like whatever.
1347760	1350320	There's so much garbage in Lawtech.
1350320	1354240	Like just to make like an unordered list or something,
1354240	1357200	it takes so much effort mentally and so much,
1357200	1360720	you have to remember so much like you might as well just ask AI
1360720	1362880	to write the Lawtech document for you.
1362880	1364800	If you're going to write something yourself,
1364800	1366400	don't write it in Lawtech.
1366400	1368320	If you want math equations,
1368320	1372960	well also don't use Google Docs and like go and look through a big menu
1372960	1376320	with like a big table like, oh, where's my, how do I make a fraction?
1376320	1378320	Oh, I got to go look for the fraction.
1378320	1380000	Oh, I got to do the square root.
1380000	1384720	Instead of doing the goofy parts of Lawtech in Lawtech,
1384720	1387680	do all the goofy parts of Lawtech in Markdown.
1387680	1392160	Using Pandok, you can embed Lawtech into your Markdown.
1392160	1394000	So you get all the upsides of Lawtech.
1394000	1397200	You can put Lawtech equations into your Markdown.
1397200	1401600	And then you don't have to do titles or headings with Lawtech.
1401600	1407600	If you want to be a boomer and write your whole page in just raw HTML,
1407600	1411680	well, you also don't have an excuse for not using Markdown in Pandok.
1412640	1416160	You can embed HTML into your Markdown.
1416240	1420400	If a template isn't working for you, finally,
1420400	1425920	how many times have you seen a code example in a PDF or something,
1425920	1430160	especially if you're like a college, like a CS major, right?
1431760	1434240	The professors, they're always putting these.
1434240	1438480	They just put these like black and white, like they paste code into Google Docs
1438480	1439840	and it's black and white.
1439840	1442560	It's not even, sometimes it's not even mono space.
1442560	1444560	And there's no syntax highlighting.
1444640	1446400	This is so goofy.
1446400	1450320	There's an obvious solution and they just don't bother to find it.
1450320	1450880	Okay.
1450880	1457840	The solution is the same thing that your read me uses on GitHub.
1457840	1462240	When you have a GitHub read me, you write Markdown and you put your code in.
1462240	1465440	And you do like three backs, backticks.
1465440	1471920	And then you put the name of the programming language that the code is made out of, right?
1472000	1478640	And then the GitHub interprets the GitHub interpreter
1478640	1483680	for the Markdown converts it into HTML or PDF,
1483680	1485520	or I guess you could get a PDF or whatever.
1486720	1490800	It does that with correct syntax highlighting for the language.
1490800	1493360	You can do that with Pandok and Markdown.
1493360	1496000	You don't need GitHub's version or whatever.
1496000	1496640	I do this.
1496640	1499200	I've done this a million times every time I put code in,
1499280	1502480	I specify the language into the Markdown file.
1502480	1504400	I embed that code in there.
1504400	1508000	And then when I export it as HTML, it looks beautiful.
1508000	1510560	It's correctly syntax highlights it.
1510560	1513760	It's all mono space, or yeah, it's all mono space.
1515040	1519760	PDF, PDF sometimes breaks if you have really wide code like a comment.
1519760	1521440	It's like goes on forever.
1521440	1525600	But if you export as HTML, you use the standalone flag.
1525600	1528000	It'll give you a scrollable region.
1528080	1529520	So it'll get cut off.
1529520	1534480	But if you want to see the rest of the line, you can scroll horizontally.
1534480	1539520	So I want to emphasize, like if I wish I had a book to write,
1539520	1543440	I wish I was like some kind of novelist or author or something,
1543440	1547200	because it is so enjoyable writing Markdown.
1547200	1552960	Every time I write Markdown, I'm just, I'm going to climax when I write Markdown, okay?
1553920	1557600	We got to stop writing inward or docs, okay?
1557600	1560880	Especially as programmers, it's cringe.
1560880	1562080	We got to stop doing this.
1564000	1567760	We shouldn't be rewriting static site generators.
1567760	1570960	When Pandok does it for us, it's, I installed it once,
1570960	1572800	and it's amazing and beautiful.
1572800	1575680	And then next time you're going to make some slides,
1575680	1577040	consider using Pandok.
1577040	1579840	Next time you're going to make a website, go ask chat,
1580640	1585760	Hey, chat, GPT, how do I convert Markdown into HTML with a nice template
1585760	1588160	so that my HTML styling looks nice?
1588160	1590080	And just have it generated in an example template,
1590080	1592640	and then mess with it until you like the styling.
1592640	1597040	Always use Markdown for, for any writing you do,
1597040	1598640	because it's distraction free.
1598640	1599920	You don't have to worry about the styling.
1599920	1602880	You just spit out some Markdown.
1602880	1605280	And version control with Git.
1605280	1608080	Don't be relying on Google Drive or something.
1608160	1610480	And learn Git via the command line.
1610480	1614720	You don't have to learn VIM, but VIM helps when you're writing Markdown,
1614720	1617600	and when basically when you're writing anything, VIM helps.
1618640	1621840	Also, HTML is the future.
1621840	1626000	HTML is so much better than PDF, PDF is slow, it sucks.
1626000	1630720	And we need to stop like this format of like things have page breaks,
1630720	1632240	and things are cut into pages.
1632240	1634160	Nobody print stuff anymore.
1634560	1639280	And additionally, you can print your HTML if you want it printed,
1639280	1641600	and then you can get it in like a page format.
1641600	1645360	I've done that whenever I'm making a cheat sheet for my classes,
1645360	1646880	for my exams.
1646880	1649200	I'll just write it all on HTML.
1649200	1651120	Sometimes I'll even ask chat, GPT.
1651120	1653760	I'll have all the material, I'll say, hey, put this into column,
1653760	1655840	so it fits on a page nicely.
1655840	1659200	I'm not going to write that in Google Word or Google Docs.
1659200	1661600	Now, suddenly you write it in Google Docs in Google Word.
1661600	1663600	You can't even fit as much stuff on the page
1663600	1665760	as if you use HTML in the first place,
1665760	1668240	and just use the print feature, right?
1668240	1669760	You can print HTML.
1669760	1673680	You can even specify specific styling for if you're printing.
1674400	1679440	And then compare and contrast, like you're reading a textbook for your class,
1679440	1682800	versus have you ever read like a nice medium article,
1682800	1688400	or maybe someone in this channel has used LearnOpenGL.com.
1688400	1692080	Like that is such a nice website, such a nice web resource.
1692080	1693760	These web resources are so cool.
1693760	1697920	They look nice, they make you feel like an epic gamer,
1697920	1699680	just by scrolling the room.
1700640	1701760	These are my takeaways.
1701760	1706640	It took me a year to learn them, to learn Markdown, using Pandok,
1706640	1708640	using Git via the command line,
1708640	1714400	and also like December, Ish, I switched to my new keyboard layout,
1714400	1715760	and I still use that.
1715760	1717440	There's so many things you can do.
1717440	1719680	Try installing Ubuntu, try to dual boot it.
1719680	1721920	If you don't want to dual boot it, use the Windows
1721920	1724880	subsystem Linux, or whatever it's called WSL, I think.
1728240	1732640	Currently, I'm trying to set up a membership
1732640	1734640	at Ben256.com.
1735840	1737680	You can check out the website if you want,
1737680	1739040	but there's no way to sign up.
1739040	1740400	There's no way to support me there.
1741280	1744480	But I do recommend if you want updates, go to Discord.
1744480	1748400	Just don't be a butt head, but I will help you if you go to Discord.
1748400	1750880	I'm helping people out all the time there,
1750880	1753360	usually for procedural animation stuff.
1753360	1755680	There's people in there who will help you out as well,
1757120	1761680	and you can select Notify for live streams, YouTube uploads,
1761680	1763840	for code, whatever you want in there.
1763840	1768160	So you can really get granular with what kind of notifications you receive.
